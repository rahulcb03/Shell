                                                            Functionality Testing:
Batch Mode: 
1) Testing that batch mode is able to correctly read from the file provided and exucte the commands listed 
   Test: Created a file called "testbatch.txt". 
         The file "testbatch.txt" contains the content: "echo "Hello World"
                                                         ls
                                                         mkdir testdir

                                                         pwd"
          Ran the command "./mysh testbatch.txt"
          Expected output: Prints "Hello World" in the command line, then lists all the content in current directory, 
          makes a directory called "testdir", changes director to "testdir", prints content of "testdir"

Interactive Mode: 
1) bear / ">" - Testing Redirection of output along with the bear function "ls"
                Test: Created a file called "test.txt", which has no content written in it. 
                      Ran the commands "./mysh", "ls > test.txt", and then checked the content of "test.txt"

                      Ran the commands "sort < sort.txt", and then checked the content of "sort.txt"
                      Expected output: "sort.txt" contains the content "apple
                                                                        astrology

3) bear / "|" - Testing redirection of output to file along with the bear function "ls & grep"
                Test: Created a files called "myfile.txt" and "myfile" which have no content written in them. 
                Ran the commands "./mysh", "ls | grep myfile"
                Expected output: A list of all files that contain the string "myfile" will be outputted to the user. 

4) bear / "*" - Testing Wild Card functionality along with the bear function "cat"
                Test: Created files called "test1.txt", which has the content "Hello" written in it, and "test2.txt", which has the content "World" written in it.
                Ran the command "./mysh", "cat *.txt"
                Expected output: A the contents of "test1.txt" and "test2.txt" should be displayed on the terminal like so: "Hello
                                                                                                                             World"
  
5) "cd" - Testing if the change directory function works
          Test: Created a directory called "testDir" and then created a file "test.txt" within the directory
          Ran the commands "./mysh", "cd testDir", and then "ls"
          Expected output: The contents of "testDir" should be printed to the console like so: "test.txt"

6) "pwd" - Testing if the print workign directory function works 
           Test: Created a directory called "testDir" and then created the files "test1.txt" and "test2.txt within the directory 
           (no contents written in either)
           Ran the commands "./mysh", "cd testDir" and then "pwd"
           Expected output: The contents of "testDir" should be printed to the console like so: "test1.txt test2.txt"

7) "exit" - Testing if the exit key word exits program
            Test: Ran the command "./mysh", "exit"
            Expected output: The prompt "mysh: exiting" should be printed and then the program should terminate 
 
                                                                Edge Cases: 
Interactive Mode:

1) * - Testing if the program works if the wildCard is not last token 
       Test: 

2) > - Testing if the redirection can occur anywhere in the program 
   Test: 

3) |, >, < - Random Combintaion of redirections and pipes to confirm functionality
   Test:
