Project II: My shell | Rahul Badiani rb1217 & Suchit Kalluru srk170
Purpose: Create a basic command line shell "mysh.c" using only POSIX Functions. Has two modes "Batch" & "Interactive"
    - Batch: Allows the user to input a file after the command './mysh' in order to execute commands from within the file
    - Interactive : Allows the user to input multiple generic commands(one process at a time) imitating a basic command line shell found on common OS

Implementation:

1) We had to check the standard input to figure out which mode the user wanted to use. We did this by checking the number of arguments inputted 
   (1 -> Interactive | 2+ -> Batch). We then set the file descriptor to the respective mode.
   
2) Next we began tokenizing the users input(this happens regardless of the mode because both modes involve special tokens that need to be tokenized 
   to execute the desired commands). To start the process we created a loop to read until the end of file/line (depending on mode). Then we created a 
   buffer and a 'line' variable which holds the command the user wants to exectue. Then we looped through the line tokenizing each key withiin the command
   and extiing if the keyword 'exit' is hit.
